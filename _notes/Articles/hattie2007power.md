#### Super Summary:
**Feedback: Information provided by an agent regarding aspects of one's performance & understanding.** ^a416bc

Feedback is good and popular, but it's types and the variance in impact is not often mentioned. This paper proposes a model of feedback, with its particular properties and circumstances, and suggestions on its use. 

According to [[Philip Winne]]: Feedback is information with which a learner can confirm, add to, overwrite, tune, or restructure information in memory ^6fa76a

Feedback can only exist in context, it is part of the learning process, it can only come after instruction, but often they become intertwined, and it's best when it addresses faulty interpretations over a whole lack of understanding.

Meta-analysis of feedback studies sets Feedback in the top 5 factors (from more than 100) with most impact (effect size) on learning, together with Direct Instruction, Reciprocal Teaching, Prior Cognitive Ability, etc.

Effect size varies a lot by type of feedback, really high for task-specific, instructional feedback, very low for programmed instruction, praise or punishment. Even negative (-0.34) for generic rewards like stickers, and worse for controlling (-0.78), you performed as you "should" have.

Feedback should help to close the gap between current state and desired goal:

Perspective:
- Feed-Up: Current vs target status, from now to goals. *Where am I going?*
- Feed-Back: Compare to previous state or performance. *How am I going?*
- Feed-Forward: Explain target based on current state *Where to next?*

Level:
- Task - About content, superficial
- Process - On strategies, how to complete the task
- Self-Regulation - Monitoring of strategies
- Self - Personal characteristics

Praise, positive feedback on the self-level, is tricky, counter-intuitive, and often has negative impact, even for peers of the student receiving the feedback.

Immediate FT and delayed FP have better effects
